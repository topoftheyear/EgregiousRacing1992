You can easily add in your own maps to play. You will need your own colormap and heightmap.

1. Ensure the files are named according to the following convention
    : Colormap: C{mapname}.png
    : Heightmap: C{heightmap}H.png
2. Add them to this folder, and they will be automatically recognized. The map select and leaderboard screens will need
to be closed and reopened to reflect any changes.

Additional notes:
- Files will be automatically interpreted in 1024x1024 dimensions. The further your maps are from this dimension, the
more the quality will degrade.
- If you don't have a heightmap for your map, you can easily convert your image to grayscale in your favorite image
editor and get an adequate result. Otherwise, you can search online for one or borrow an existing one in this folder.
- Removed maps will keep their leaderboard in case you add them back. New maps that share a name with an old map will
use the old map's leaderboard. This is a feature.
